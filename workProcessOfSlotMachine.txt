    Step 3:
        Let it spin

    *Pay the Verifiable Random Function of Chainlink with LINK tokens:  Convert BNB/SMT to LINK to pay the function call
        *Once for the spin
        *Once for the win process if it happens 

    *Add the remaining SMT amount to the jackpot balance (do not let win the whole jackpot balance, to have some reserve if needed)

    *after a while burn some SMT tokens

    *Possibility to withdraw the remaining SMTs from the machine if the person does not want to play anymore
